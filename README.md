# No Home Carousel

Work in Progress. Do NOT use if a partnerspace is enabled!
Only tested with SailfishOS 2.0.1.7

Disables the carousel on the homescreen by removing the left side of the events-view and the right side of the switcher-view.
This allows swipe right to remove notifications in events and swipe left to close an app cover in switcher.

Future plans:
- Improve close indicator when swiping an app cover
- Fix swiping app notification groups
- Go to last app on left edge swipe in events and right edge swipe in switcher
- Investigate swipable cover actions
- Find new location for partnerspaces
