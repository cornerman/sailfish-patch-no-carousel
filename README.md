# No Home Carousel

Work in Progress. Do NOT use if a partnerspace is enabled!
Based on SailfishOS 2.0.4.13

Disables the carousel on the homescreen by removing the left side of the events-view and the right side of the switcher-view.
This allows swipe right to remove notifications in events and swipe left to close an app cover in switcher.

Issues:
- Fix swiping app notification groups

Future plans:
- Go to last app on left edge swipe in events and right edge swipe in switcher
- Investigate swipable cover actions
- Maybe separate switcher and events completely
- Find new location for partnerspaces
